# Clicker Mushroom Predicted

This is a clicker game. But it's not just any clicker it's one with predictions! In short, youâ€™re given a mushroom, and your goal is to grow it by tapping the screen to earn points. Once you've accumulated enough points, the mushroom will fully grow, and you'll receive a prediction about your near future.
